# 🧠🤖 lossless-claude

A fork and reinterpretation of [lossless-claw](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claude) by [Martian Engineering](https://martian.engineering), adapted specifically for [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code). The core ideas — DAG-based summarization, lossless message retention, and the LCM model from [Voltropy](https://x.com/Voltropy) — are theirs. This fork rewires the integration layer for Claude Code's plugin API, replaces the provider abstraction with the Anthropic SDK directly, and ships as a native Claude Code plugin. 🧠🤖

Replaces Claude Code's built-in sliding-window compaction with a DAG-based summarization system that preserves every message while keeping active context within model token limits.

## What it does

Two ways to learn: read the below, or [check out this super cool animated visualization](https://losslesscontext.ai).

When a conversation grows beyond the model's context window, Claude Code (just like all of the other agents) normally truncates older messages. LCM instead:

1. **Persists every message** in a SQLite database, organized by conversation
2. **Summarizes chunks** of older messages into summaries using your configured LLM
3. **Condenses summaries** into higher-level nodes as they accumulate, forming a DAG (directed acyclic graph)
4. **Assembles context** each turn by combining summaries + recent raw messages
5. **Provides tools** (`lcm_grep`, `lcm_describe`, `lcm_expand`) so agents can search and recall details from compacted history

Nothing is lost. Raw messages stay in the database. Summaries link back to their source messages. Agents can drill into any summary to recover the original detail.

### How compaction is triggered

Compaction is **incremental and post-turn** — not a bulk dump when the window fills up.

After every turn, the engine checks whether there's enough material to compact:

- **Leaf pass:** once `LCM_LEAF_MIN_FANOUT` (default: 8) raw messages accumulate without a summary, they're grouped into a leaf summary
- **Condensation:** once `LCM_CONDENSED_MIN_FANOUT` (default: 4) leaf summaries accumulate, they condense into a higher-level DAG node — and so on up the tree
- **Depth:** `LCM_INCREMENTAL_MAX_DEPTH=-1` lets condensation cascade as deep as needed after each pass

The context delivered to the model each turn is **assembled fresh** from summaries + recent raw messages (`LCM_FRESH_TAIL_COUNT`, default: 32) + Cipher recall. The raw history never accumulates in the context window — it lives in SQLite and is represented by summaries instead.

The result: the context window never "fills up and dumps". It stays within `LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD` (default: 75%) at all times.

**It feels like talking to an agent that never forgets. Because it doesn't. In normal operation, you'll never need to think about compaction again.**

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code with plugin context engine support
- Node.js 22+
- An LLM provider configured in Claude Code (used for summarization)

### Install the plugin

Use Claude Code's plugin installer (recommended):

```bash
claude plugins install @ipedro/lossless-claude
```

If you're running from a local Claude Code checkout, use:

```bash
pnpm claude plugins install @ipedro/lossless-claude
```

For local plugin development, link your working copy instead of copying files:

```bash
claude plugins install --link /path/to/lossless-claude
# or from a local Claude Code checkout:
# pnpm claude plugins install --link /path/to/lossless-claude
```

The install command records the plugin, enables it, and applies compatible slot selection (including `contextEngine` when applicable).

### Configure Claude Code

In most cases, no manual JSON edits are needed after `claude plugins install`.

If you need to set it manually, ensure the context engine slot points at lossless-claude:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": {
      "contextEngine": "lossless-claude"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code after configuration changes.

## Configuration

LCM is configured through a combination of plugin config and environment variables. Environment variables take precedence for backward compatibility.

### Plugin config

Add a `lossless-claude` entry under `plugins.entries` in your Claude Code config:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "lossless-claude": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "freshTailCount": 32,
          "contextThreshold": 0.75,
          "incrementalMaxDepth": -1
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LCM_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable/disable the plugin |
| `LCM_DATABASE_PATH` | `~/.claude/lcm.db` | Path to the SQLite database |
| `LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD` | `0.75` | Fraction of context window that triggers compaction (0.0–1.0) |
| `LCM_FRESH_TAIL_COUNT` | `32` | Number of recent messages protected from compaction |
| `LCM_LEAF_MIN_FANOUT` | `8` | Minimum raw messages per leaf summary |
| `LCM_CONDENSED_MIN_FANOUT` | `4` | Minimum summaries per condensed node |
| `LCM_CONDENSED_MIN_FANOUT_HARD` | `2` | Relaxed fanout for forced compaction sweeps |
| `LCM_INCREMENTAL_MAX_DEPTH` | `0` | How deep incremental compaction goes (0 = leaf only, -1 = unlimited) |
| `LCM_LEAF_CHUNK_TOKENS` | `20000` | Max source tokens per leaf compaction chunk |
| `LCM_LEAF_TARGET_TOKENS` | `1200` | Target token count for leaf summaries |
| `LCM_CONDENSED_TARGET_TOKENS` | `2000` | Target token count for condensed summaries |
| `LCM_MAX_EXPAND_TOKENS` | `4000` | Token cap for sub-agent expansion queries |
| `LCM_LARGE_FILE_TOKEN_THRESHOLD` | `25000` | File blocks above this size are intercepted and stored separately |
| `LCM_LARGE_FILE_SUMMARY_PROVIDER` | `""` | Provider override for large-file summarization |
| `LCM_LARGE_FILE_SUMMARY_MODEL` | `""` | Model override for large-file summarization |
| `LCM_SUMMARY_MODEL` | *(from Claude Code)* | Model for summarization (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) |
| `LCM_SUMMARY_PROVIDER` | *(from Claude Code)* | Provider override for summarization |
| `LCM_AUTOCOMPACT_DISABLED` | `false` | Disable automatic compaction after turns |
| `LCM_PRUNE_HEARTBEAT_OK` | `false` | Retroactively delete `HEARTBEAT_OK` turn cycles from LCM storage |

### Recommended starting configuration

```
LCM_FRESH_TAIL_COUNT=32
LCM_INCREMENTAL_MAX_DEPTH=-1
LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD=0.75
```

- **freshTailCount=32** protects the last 32 messages from compaction, giving the model enough recent context for continuity.
- **incrementalMaxDepth=-1** enables unlimited automatic condensation after each compaction pass — the DAG cascades as deep as needed. Set to `0` (default) for leaf-only, or a positive integer for a specific depth cap.
- **contextThreshold=0.75** triggers compaction when context reaches 75% of the model's window, leaving headroom for the model's response.

### Claude Code session reset settings

LCM preserves history through compaction, but it does **not** change Claude Code's core session reset policy. If sessions are resetting sooner than you want, increase Claude Code's `session.reset.idleMinutes` or use a channel/type-specific override.

```json
{
  "session": {
    "reset": {
      "mode": "idle",
      "idleMinutes": 10080
    }
  }
}
```

- `session.reset.mode: "idle"` keeps a session alive until the idle window expires.
- `session.reset.idleMinutes` is the actual reset interval in minutes.
- Claude Code does **not** currently enforce a maximum `idleMinutes`; in source it is validated only as a positive integer.
- If you also use daily reset mode, `idleMinutes` acts as a secondary guard and the session resets when **either** the daily boundary or the idle window is reached first.
- Legacy `session.idleMinutes` still works, but Claude Code prefers `session.reset.idleMinutes`.

Useful values:

- `1440` = 1 day
- `10080` = 7 days
- `43200` = 30 days
- `525600` = 365 days

For most long-lived LCM setups, a good starting point is:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "reset": {
      "mode": "idle",
      "idleMinutes": 10080
    }
  }
}
```

lossless-claude stands on the shoulders of [lossless-claw](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claude), the original implementation by [Martian Engineering](https://martian.engineering). The DAG-based compaction architecture, the LCM memory model, and the foundational design decisions all originate there. This fork would not exist without their work — we're grateful for it and for making it open source.
